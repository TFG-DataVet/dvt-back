/**
 * Clinic Application Mappers Package
 * 
 * This package contains mappers for converting between domain objects and DTOs
 * in the Clinic domain. Mappers handle the transformation logic between different
 * representations of the same data.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Mappers should be stateless and focused on data transformation
 * - Mappers should handle null values and edge cases gracefully
 * - Complex mapping logic should be well-documented
 * - Mappers should not contain business logic
