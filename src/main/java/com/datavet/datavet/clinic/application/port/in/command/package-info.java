/**
 * Clinic Application Input Commands Package
 * 
 * This package contains command objects for the Clinic domain input ports.
 * Commands encapsulate the data and validation rules for operations that
 * modify the state of the Clinic domain.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Commands should be immutable data containers
 * - Commands should include validation logic for business rules
 * - Commands should represent complete operations with all required data
 * - Commands should be self-validating and fail fast on invalid data
 *
