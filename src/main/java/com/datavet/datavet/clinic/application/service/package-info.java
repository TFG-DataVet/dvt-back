/**
 * Clinic Application Services Package
 * 
 * This package contains application services for the Clinic domain.
 * Application services orchestrate domain operations and coordinate between different layers.
 * They implement use cases and handle cross-cutting concerns like transactions and security.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Application services should be thin and focus on orchestration
 * - Business logic should be delegated to domain services and entities
 * - Services should handle transaction boundaries and security concerns
 * - Services should coordinate between domain objects and external systems
