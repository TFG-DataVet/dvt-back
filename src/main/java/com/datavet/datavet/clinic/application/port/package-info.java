/**
 * Clinic Application Ports Package
 * 
 * This package contains the port interfaces for the Clinic domain following
 * the hexagonal architecture pattern. Ports define the contracts between
 * the application core and external adapters.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Ports should define clear contracts for external interactions
 * - Input ports (use cases) define what the application can do
 * - Output ports define what the application needs from external systems
 * - Ports should be technology-agnostic interfaces
