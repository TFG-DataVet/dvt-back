/**
 * Clinic Application Input Ports Package
 * 
 * This package contains input port interfaces (use cases) for the Clinic domain.
 * Input ports define the operations that can be performed on the Clinic domain
 * and represent the application's public API.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Input ports should represent business use cases
 * - Interfaces should be focused and cohesive
 * - Use cases should be named from the user's perspective
 * - Input ports should define clear input and output contracts
