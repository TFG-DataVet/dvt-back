/**
 * Clinic Domain Services Package
 * 
 * This package contains domain services for the Clinic domain.
 * Domain services encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally fit within a single entity
 * or when the operation involves multiple domain objects.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Domain services should contain pure business logic
 * - Services should be stateless and focused on specific business operations
 * - Complex business rules involving multiple entities should be implemented here
 * - Domain services should not depend on infrastructure concerns
