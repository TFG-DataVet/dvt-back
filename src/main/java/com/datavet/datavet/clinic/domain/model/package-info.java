/**
 * Clinic Domain Models Package
 * 
 * This package contains the core domain entities and value objects for the Clinic domain.
 * Domain models represent the business concepts and encapsulate business rules and logic.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Domain models should be rich in behavior, not just data containers
 * - Business rules and invariants should be enforced within the domain models
 * - Domain models should be independent of infrastructure concerns
 * - Value objects should be immutable and represent domain concepts
