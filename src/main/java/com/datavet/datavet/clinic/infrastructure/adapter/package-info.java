/**
 * Clinic Infrastructure Adapters Package
 * 
 * This package contains adapter implementations for the Clinic domain.
 * Adapters implement the port interfaces and handle the integration between
 * the domain core and external systems, frameworks, and technologies.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Adapters should implement port interfaces from the application layer
 * - Adapters should handle technology-specific concerns
 * - Adapters should translate between domain objects and external formats
 * - Adapters should be replaceable without affecting the domain logic
