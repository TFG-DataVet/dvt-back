/**
 * Clinic Infrastructure Persistence Entities Package
 * 
 * This package contains JPA entity classes for the Clinic domain.
 * These entities represent the database schema and handle the mapping
 * between domain objects and relational database tables.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - JPA entities should be focused on persistence concerns
 * - Entities should be separate from domain models to avoid coupling
 * - Entities should include appropriate JPA annotations and constraints
 * - Entities should handle database-specific optimizations and relationships
 *
