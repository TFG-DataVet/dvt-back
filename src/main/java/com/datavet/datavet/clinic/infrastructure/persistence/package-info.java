/**
 * Clinic Infrastructure Persistence Package
 * 
 * This package contains persistence-related components for the Clinic domain.
 * This includes JPA entities, repository implementations, and database-specific
 * configuration and utilities.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - Persistence components should be isolated from domain logic
 * - JPA entities should be separate from domain entities
 * - Repository implementations should handle data mapping and transactions
 * - Database schema should be optimized for the domain's access patterns
 *
